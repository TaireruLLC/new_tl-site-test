## 28. Policy Creation Policy
This policy outlines the procedure for creating, revising, and maintaining company policies at Taireru LLC to ensure consistency, clarity, and effectiveness in policy development and implementation.
- **Policy Development Process**:
  - **Initiation**: Any employee may propose a new policy or suggest revisions to an existing one. Proposals should be submitted in writing to the CEO, President, or Vice President, who will evaluate the necessity and feasibility of the proposed policy.
  - **Policy Drafting**: Once a proposal is approved, the CEO or President may designate a responsible party or committee to draft the policy. The drafting process should involve research, consultation with relevant stakeholders, and alignment with legal requirements and industry standards.
  - **Review and Feedback**: The draft policy should be circulated among key stakeholders, including department directors, HR, and legal advisors, for review and feedback. Input from affected employees may also be solicited.
  - **Approval**: After incorporating feedback and revisions, the final policy draft is submitted to the CEO or President for approval. If necessary, the policy may also be reviewed by the Board of Directors or shareholders, depending on its significance.
  - **Publication**: Once approved, the policy is published on the company's internal communication channels, such as the company's intranet or document management system, or Discord channel, and made accessible to all employees.
- **Policy Maintenance**:
  - **Regular Review**: All policies will be subject to periodic review to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness. The frequency of these reviews will depend on the nature and significance of the policy.
  - **Responsibility**: The Director of Human Resources or a designated policy manager is responsible for overseeing the policy review process, ensuring that policies are up to date, and initiating revisions as needed.
  - **Notification of Changes**: Whenever a policy is revised, employees will be notified of the changes, and the updated policy will replace the previous version in the company's policy repository.
- **Policy Retention**:
  - **Archiving**: All retired or obsolete policies will be archived and retained for a specified period, as required by legal and regulatory standards.
  - **Compliance**:
    - **Employee Awareness**: All employees are responsible for familiarizing themselves with company policies and adhering to them in the course of their duties.

- **Exceptions**:
  - **Special Circumstances**: In certain situations where an immediate policy change is required to address an urgent issue, the CEO or President may issue a temporary policy or directive. Such temporary policies will be reviewed and formalized through the standard policy development process as soon as possible.
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Policies can be submitted to the Vice President for approval and modification, but the only case in which the Vice President can approve policies without consulting the President or CEO is when both the CEO and President are unavailable. "Unavailable" means, but is not limited to, out of the country, on vacation, in the hospital, or unresponsive for three months. In such an event, while the Vice President can approve policies, they must have support from five or more shareholders and two board directors. While the Vice President can approve and/or modify policies, they can only modify policies other than Policy 28, Policy 27, Policy 26, Policy 24, Policy 23, and Policy 5. If a policy is being modified and/or added by the Vice President and during that time the CEO and/or President becomes available, they can cancel the policy without repercussions. Additionally, any support from shareholders and board directors must be verified by contract and given to the CEO and/or President when they become available again. If the contracts do not check out, the Vice President's contract can be temporarily terminated for five years or permanently terminated.
